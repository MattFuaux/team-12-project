# Fruit Watch Android App v0.2

Author: Cameron Akers

## What is the app used for?

The Fruit Watch Android app is simply used as a frontend for the Fruit Watch project. The app will first ask for a users credentials to log in to their required Fruit Watch account. Once logged in the app then provides the user with the ability to start a search by taking a picture, then viewing the results of that search on their mobile smartphone. The app also will keep track of previous searches that the user has made so they can be viewed when ever or searched again at a later time.

## What is the app NOT used for?

The Fruit Watch Android app is just a frontend. It does not process the image used to initiate the search, nor does it actually conduct the search for the item.

## Implemented Features

- Full Authentication (Registration, Login and Logout)
- Navigation through various screens (Home, History, Settings)
- Ability to start a search by taking a picture
- Ability to show search results to the screen (Dummy Data currently used)

## Not Implemented Features
